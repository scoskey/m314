## Week 1, due Thursday, January 21 (end of day)

1. (Abbott, ex 1.2.1)  
  * Study the proof that there is no rational number $q$ such that $q^2=2$. Modify this proof to show that there is no rational number $q$ such that $q^2=3$.
  * Obviously there *is* a rational number such that $q^2=4$, so your proof in the previous part cannot work if $3$ is replaced by $4$. Point out *exactly* which part of your proof would fail and explain why.
2. (Abbott, ex 8.6.2). Suppose that $C$ is a cut, $q\in C$, and that $r$ is a rational number such that $r\notin C$. Show that $q\lt r$.
3. (Abbott, ex 8.6.3). Read the five properties of a field listed in Definition 8.6.4. Which of these properties are possessed by $\mathbb N$? By $\mathbb Z$? By $\mathbb Q$? Explain your answers.
4. Modify a proof given in class to instead show that the cut $\set{q\in\mathbb Q\mid q^3<2}$ has no last element.
5. Let $A$ and $B$ be sets of real numbers, and assume every element of $A$ is less than every element of $B$.  
   * Prove that $\sup(A)\leq\sup(B)$.
   * Give an example showing it is possible that $\sup(A)=\sup(B)$.
