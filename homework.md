## Homework 1, due Thursday, January 23 at 3pm

1. (Abbott, ex 8.6.2). Suppose that $C$ is a cut, $q\in C$, and that $r$ is a rational number such that $r\notin C$. Show that $q\lt r$.
2. (Abbott, ex 1.2.1)
  * Study the proof that there is no rational number $q$ such that $q^2=2$. Modify this proof to show that there is no rational number $q$ such that $q^2=3$.
  * Obviously there *is* a rational number such that $q^2=4$, so your proof in the previous part cannot work if $3$ is replaced by $4$. But where *exactly* does the proof break down?
3. Let $A$ and $B$ be points in the plane.
  * Suppose that $A$ is $3$ units away from the origin and $B$ is $5$ units away from the origin. What is the farthest $A$ and $B$ can be from each other? The closest?
  * Now generalize. Suppose that $A$ is $\abs{A}$ units away from the origin and that $B$ is $\abs{B}$ units away from the origin.  Use the notation $\abs{A-B}$ for the distance between $A$ and $B$. Can you write two rules that generalize your two answers from the previous part? (Explain your answer with a picture. You do not need to give a proof.)
4. Modify a proof given in class to instead show that the cut $\set{q\in\mathbb Q\mid q^3<2}$ has no last element.
5. (Abbott, ex 8.6.3) Read the definition of a "field" of numbers and note the list of properties which must be true of a field. Which of these properties are satisfied in $\mathbb N$? In $\mathbb Z$? In $\mathbb Q$?
