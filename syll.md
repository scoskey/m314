## Course goals

Real analysis is one of the core areas of modern pure mathematics. It is also the subject that provides the foundations for first-year calculus. It is important for aspiring math practitioners and educators alike to become familiar with real analysis. In this class we will also be exposed to rigorous mathematical thinking, reasoning, problem solving, and proof. My goals for this course include guiding you to further appreciate beauty in abstract concepts, become more fluent in the language of mathematics, become more comfortable discovering mathematical truth, and gain new experience writing rigorous and readable proofs.

## Course topics

We will begin by discussing a simple but surprisingly deep question: *what are real numbers*? The answer to this question will lead us to the key concept of *completeness*. And with this concept in hand, will be able to undertake a rigorous study of the most familiar concepts from calculus: *limits*, *series*, *continuity*, and *derivatives*.  (Sadly we will not have much time for integration.) Our study of continuity will take us on a short tour of the theory of *topology*&mdash;the study of abstract spaces where, like on the real line, continuity makes sense.

## Daily prep and classwork

Reading will be assigned prior to each class. You are expected to arrive prepared to ask questions and discuss the material. All homework assignments will begin as in-class group work. Daily participation and collaboration are required. A small discretionary portion of your grade will be based on your attendance, attention, and collaboration.

## Homework

All homework assignments will begin as in-class group work, which we will begin following each lecture. Your written solutions will be collected on the following Monday. All work well be evaluated for completeness, and certain items will be evaluated for correcteness and mathematical style. You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers inside and outised of class, and you are free to use online resources when you are stuck. But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.
