## Course goals

Real analysis is one of the core areas of modern pure mathematics. It is also the subject that provides the foundations for first-year calculus. It is important for aspiring math practitioners and educators alike to become familiar with real analysis. In this class we will also be exposed to rigorous mathematical thinking, reasoning, problem solving, and proof. My goals for this course include guiding you to further appreciate beauty in abstract concepts, become more fluent in the language of mathematics, become more comfortable discovering mathematical truth, and gain new experience writing rigorous and readable proofs.

## Course topics

We will begin by discussing a simple but surprisingly deep question: *what are real numbers*? The answer to this question will lead us to the key concept of *completeness*. And with this concept in hand, will be able to undertake a rigorous study of the most familiar concepts from calculus: *limits*, *series*, *continuity*, and *derivatives*.  (Sadly we will not have much time for integration.) Our study of continuity will take us on a short tour of the theory of *topology*&mdash;the study of abstract spaces where, like on the real line, continuity makes sense.

## Homework

Assignments will be started in class at the end of each lecture and collected on the following Monday. All work well be evaluated for completeness, and certain problems will be evaluated for correcteness and mathematical style. You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers, and you are welcome to use online resources when you are stuck. But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.

## Participation

In-class group work is required and will be a part of most class meetings.  A small discretionary portion of your grade will be based on your attendance, attention, and collaboration.
