## Course content

Real analysis is one of the core areas of modern mathematics. It is also the subject that provides the foundations for introductory calculus. The course content is valuable for both aspiring math practitioners and future educators. In this class we will also be exposed to rigorous mathematical thinking, reasoning, problem solving, and proof.

We will begin by discussing a simple but surprisingly deep question: *what are real numbers*? The answer to this question will lead us to a key concept, the *completeness* of the real numbers. With an understanding of completeness, will be able to undertake a rigorous study of familiar concepts from calculus: *limits*, *series*, *continuity*, and of course *derivatives* and *integrals*. Our study of continuity will also take us on a short tour of the theory of *topology*&mdash;the abstract study of continuity and its properties.

## Classwork

You are expected to attend class, prepared to ask questions and discuss the material. Following the discussion, we will start an in-class activity. A small portion of your grade will be based on attendance, attention, collaboration and completion of these activities.

## Homework

Weekly homework will be assigned each Wednesday and collected the following Tuesday. All work will be evaluated for completeness, and certain items will be evaluated for correcteness and mathematical style. You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers inside and outside of class, and you are free to use online resources when you are stuck. But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.
